A simple sample on Dagger 2 Dependency Injection on a full java (non android) application.

Although Dagger 2 (and 1 also) was design to catch Android performance,
it's a also a perfect solution as an IoC container on a full java server application.


Setup and dependencies for Dagger2 are based on [this pull request.](https://github.com/JakeWharton/u2020/pull/42/files#diff-ed0e94b729fde7f6d8995b93667cd615R20)

Example is based on @JakeWharton #Devoxx2014 session on Dagger2
